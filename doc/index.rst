Welcome to Lcapy-gui's documentation!
=====================================

The Lcapy-gui package provides the lcapy-tk program, a graphical user
interface for symbolic circuit analysis.  Schematics can be created
and saved in a number of formats and symbolic component voltages,
currents, and impedances can be inspected.

The user interface is under development but has many features, such as
displaying the system of equations for loop, nodal, and modified nodal
analysis and creating transfer functions, two-port models, and
state-space models.

Lcapy-tk utilizes Lcapy for symbolic linear circuit analysis and
signal-processing, see https://lcapy.readthedocs.io.

If you have suggestions for improvements, please create an issue at
https://github.com/mph-/lcapy-gui/issues.

If you are using Lcapy for teaching, please email to :`''.join(reversed(['nz', '.', 'ac', '.', 'canterbury', '@', 'hayes', '.', 'michael']))`.
